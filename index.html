  <h4>Why I Think SMS OTPs Are Easier To Hack Than You Think .ep1|</h4> 
  <h6 id="post_meta_data">Author: TheVimVictim . . . Date: 28 Aug 2025 . . . Est Time: 4min</h6>

  <p>
    In this blog, imagine I am the hacker and Mr. Bob is the victim.  
    Bob banks with PhishBank, a new bank in town. Bob loves PhishBank because of 
    their excellent online services. Bob has a strong password and he knows not to share it 
    with anyone because Bob has a lot of money in his account.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Since PhishBank is new, they roll out constant updates. So, they send Bob emails about new 
    features and upgrades all the time. Bob does not mind these emails because Bob is in love with this bank.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, my problem is... I want Bob’s money, <span class="highlight">all of it</span>. But I know Bob's 
    password is strong and very hard to guess and I know PhishBank sends SMS One-Time Password (OTP) to their customers 
    as a security measure. Now, I have to find a way to get his password and then the OTP. Tough times!
  </p>

  <p>
    So, I got this idea: Trick Bob into giving the credentials directly to me. I register a domain name that looks almost 
    like phishbank.com (something like PhishBank.co or ph1shbank.com). Then, I send him an email:  
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>“Good day Mr. Bob, we have a new update on the system. Please log in within the next hour 
    to avoid losing access. Click here to log in."</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Bob panics. Afraid of losing his money, he rushes to the provided login link, enters his username and password. 
    Seconds later, he receives an OTP SMS 
    from the <strong><em>real</em></strong> PhishBank. He types it in. Lovely, Bob gets a thumbs up message on his screen. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>Thank you Mr Bob, you have access.</em>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Everything looks normal… or does it?  
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Here’s the truth</span>: Bob was never on the real site.  
    He handed his login credentials directly to me.  
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Here's how I did it</span>: I created a fake login page that <strong><em>looks</em></strong> 
    exactly like the real PhishBank's.
    My fake login page captured his details and stored them in my database.  
    A script I wrote forwarded the credentials to the real PhishBank system, that way, 
    Bob still gets his OTP which he will then give to me.

    And just like that… <br> I AM IN!!!

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don’t click suspicious links</strong> – Go learn about URL structures. Worth 2min of your time.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify sender email/number</strong> – Go learn about domains and their standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Look for HTTPS</strong> – But remember, HTTPS alone doesn’t mean it’s safe.</li>
    <li><strong>Check grammar and urgency tactics</strong> – “Act now or lose access!” is a red flag.</li>
    <li><strong>Call the bank if unsure</strong> – Use the number on the back of your card, not the one in the email.</li>
    <li><strong>Report suspicious communications</strong> – Forward phishing emails/SMS to the bank’s fraud team.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>THIS POST IS BASED ON A LAB I USE TO EDUCATE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT THE DANGERS OF 
    INSECURE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, Bob AND PhishBank ARE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS.
    HACKING A SYSTEM WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE SYSTEM'S OWNER IS A VERY SERIOUS AND PUNISHABLE OFFENSE
    DO NOT DO IT.
