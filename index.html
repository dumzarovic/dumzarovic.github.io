  <h1>Welcome To VimVictimSpace</h1>
  <h2>I Blog About Stuff I Find Interesting</h2>

  <h3 id="post_header">Hackers steal creds of unsuspecting end users, here's how they do it!</h3>
  <h4 id="post_description">This is how I think hackers steal from end users</h4>

  <p>
    In this blog, imagine <span class="highlight">I am the hacker</span> and Mr. Bob is the victim.  
    Bob banks with <strong>PhishBank</strong>, a new bank in town. He loves PhishBank because of 
    their excellent online services. Bob has a strong, secure password (he doesn’t share it with anyone) 
    and a lot of money in his account.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Since PhishBank is new, they roll out constant updates. Naturally, they send Bob emails about new 
    features and upgrades. Bob trusts these emails because… well, PhishBank is a great bank, right?  
  </p>

  <p>
    Now here’s where I step in. I want Bob’s money — <em>a lot of it</em>. But I’m wary of those 
    cybersecurity folks with their dozens of certificates lurking around.  
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Instead of attacking the fortress, why not trick the man holding the keys?”  
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    So, I try a different approach: targeting Bob directly. I register a domain name that looks almost 
    like PhishBank’s. Then, I send him an email:  
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>“Good day Mr. Bob, we have a new update on the system. Please log in within the next hour 
    to avoid losing access.”</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Bob panics. Afraid of losing his wealth, he rushes to the provided login link — not realizing 
    it’s my fake site. He enters his username and password. Seconds later, he receives an OTP SMS 
    from the real PhishBank. He dutifully types it in. Everything looks normal… or does it?  
  </p>

  <p>
    Here’s the truth: Bob was never on the real site.  
    He handed his login credentials directly to me.  
  </p>

  <p>
    My fake login page captured his details and stored them in my database.  
    A script I wrote even forwarded the credentials to the real PhishBank system to keep things 
    looking legit — that way, Bob still gets his OTP and thinks all is fine.  
  </p>

  <p class="dramatic">
    And just like that… <br> I AM IN!!!
